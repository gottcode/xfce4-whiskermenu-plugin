About
=====

Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you open
it you are shown a list of applications you have marked as favorites. You
can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the
category buttons on the side. Top level categories make browsing fast,
and simple to switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu keeps a list of
the last ten applications that you've launched from it.

Favorites are easy to add and reorder. When browsing through your
applications, right-click on any of them and select "Add to Favorites".
Simply drag and drop your favorites list to arrange them to suit your
needs. You can remove them at any time from another right-click option.

If you're not sure exactly where a program is listed, instead of browsing
through each category you can simply enter a search term. The search
field is focused when opening the menu, so you can just start typing.
Application descriptions as well as names are searched, which allows you
to find a program by using a general word (such as "browser" to find all
web browsers installed on your computer).


Keyboard Shortcut
=================

A script to open and close Whisker Menu from the keyboard is included.
To enable support, open the keyboard preferences
['All Settings' -> 'Keyboard' -> 'Application Shortcuts']. Add a shortcut
for the command 'xfce4-popup-whiskermenu' and bind it to the keyboard
shortcut of your choice.


Compiz Workaround
=================

To allow Whisker Menu to focus the search field when shown under compiz
you will need to add it to the list of windows ignored by compiz's keyboard
focus prevention. Open the focus prevention of the compiz settings
manager [ccsm -> 'General Settings' -> 'Focus Prevention'].
Add (title="Whisker Menu") to the exclude pattern to make compiz ignore
Whisker Menu and allow it to focus when shown.
